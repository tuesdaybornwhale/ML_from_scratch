This repo seeks to build some simple ML projects from scratch using no ML libraries. The only project on here so far is a simple image classifier for MNIST data.

The code in the image classifier project is largely inspired by the code found on 
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning.

update 2023-08-31 the code for the class network is more or less sketched (still not debugged). The major piece missing is the loading of MNIST data itself.
